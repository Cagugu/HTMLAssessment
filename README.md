#HTML ASSESSMENT

###This project was the an introductory level project for learning the basics of HTML.

##Technologies Used
This project was written using the Atom test editor. Information regarding implementation of certain element type was retrieved from https://www.w3schools.com/.

##How to Use or View This Project
This project can be viewed by downloaded the included files into a single folder. Open your chrome browser, and use command+"O" to access the file explorer. Choose assessment.html. You will be able to use the form fields as intended. The "submit" button will redirect you to an "ERR_File_Not_Found" page.

##Biggest Takeaways While Writing 
Readability in HTML seems to depend on formatting. The built in "name" values in most of the elements will definitely be something that will become more and more valuable as the webpages become more complex. I also like the heading option. It's like being able to place things into a class in Java.

##Next Steps
I am looking forward to learning how to format the webpages. I played with formatting on the table section of this project but only because I felt it was essential in making the table readable. I am excited to learn how to intake information from the form part of an html project and use implement it using Java.
